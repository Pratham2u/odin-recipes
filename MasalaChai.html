    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Masala chai (literally "mixed-spice tea") is a popular, aromatic Indian beverage made by brewing black tea with a
        blend of aromatic spices like cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper, combined with milk, water,
        and a sweetener (usually sugar). Its flavor profile varies widely as spice proportions differ by household and
        region, but the core is a strong, flavorful, spicy, and milky tea often served hot. </p>
