    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An Oreo milkshake is a popular, indulgent, and creamy beverage made by blending Oreo cookies, vanilla ice cream,
        and milk, often resulting in a "cookies and cream" texture. It is frequently served as a treat, especially
        during warm weather, and is a staple in many cafes and fast-food restaurants.
